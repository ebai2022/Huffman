Hi Adithi! It's been a while sine we atually were able to hat so if you ever have time we should go get food haha.
Just wanted to say that I'm very grateful that you are my TA for my first quarter in ollege - I've heard many of my
friends omplain about their TA's in their respetive lasses (saying their TA's are boring, unknowledgable, harsh graders, et.)
so I an truly say that you are a great TA - smart, interesting, aring about our learning, and funny (wath more world up :p).
Elaine said you're raked so I want to know more about what you've done :) you an also tell me about party elaine lolol ANYWAYS
I'm ending this here so you don't have to read too muh ause I know you're busy. Have a great week! -- Ethan Bai
